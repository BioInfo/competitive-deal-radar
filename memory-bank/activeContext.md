2. Finalize the dashboard KPI cards implementation
3. Enhance the deal filtering capabilities
4. Improve the indication heatmap visualization
5. Add unit tests for core components

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. Transition from local JSON to database storage
2. Implement data export functionality
3. Add advanced filtering and search capabilities
4. Enhance the company profile pages with additional metrics
5. Implement basic analytics for deal trends

### Long-term (Future Roadmap)
1. Implement authentication and user management
2. Integrate with external deal databases via APIs
3. Add Slack/Teams notification capabilities
4. Develop the deal valuation analytics module
5. Implement ElasticSearch for advanced search functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Under Consideration
1. **State Management Approach**:
   - Current: React Query for server state, React Context for UI state
   - Considering: Adding Zustand for more complex global state management
   - Decision factors: Complexity needs, performance, developer experience

2. **Chart Library Selection**:
   - Current: Mix of Recharts and D3.js
   - Considering: Standardizing on one approach
   - Decision factors: Flexibility, performance, ease of customization

3. **API Structure**:
   - Current: Simple REST endpoints
   - Considering: GraphQL for more flexible data fetching
   - Decision factors: Client needs, query complexity, development timeline

### UX Considerations
1. **Filtering Interface**:
   - Current: Basic filter dropdowns
   - Considering: More advanced faceted filtering with saved filters
   - Decision factors: User feedback, complexity vs. usability

2. **Mobile Experience**:
   - Current: Responsive but simplified
   - Considering: Mobile-specific optimizations for key workflows
   - Decision factors: Mobile usage analytics, user feedback

3. **Data Visualization Density**:
   - Current: Focused on clarity with limited data points
   - Considering: Options for power users to see more dense visualizations
   - Decision factors: User personas, use case requirements

### Business Considerations
1. **MVP Scope**:
   - Current: Focus on core visualization and exploration features
   - Tension: Requests for additional analytics capabilities
   - Approach: Maintaining MVP discipline while documenting future enhancements

2. **Data Freshness**:
   - Current: Manual updates to JSON files
   - Considering: Automated data pipeline for regular updates
   - Decision factors: Resource availability, data source access

3. **User Onboarding**:
   - Current: Minimal documentation
   - Considering: Interactive tutorials and tooltips
   - Decision factors: User feedback, complexity of workflows

## Current Challenges

1. **Performance with Large Datasets**: Ensuring smooth performance when filtering and visualizing large numbers of deals.

2. **Visualization Clarity**: Balancing information density with clarity in the heatmap and timeline visualizations.

3. **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistent data structures across different views and components.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent experience across different browsers and devices.

5. **Feature Prioritization**: Balancing core functionality with nice-to-have features within the MVP timeline.

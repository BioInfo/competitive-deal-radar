## Current Status

### MVP Development: In Progress
- **Phase**: Early development
- **Focus**: Core UI components and data structures
- **Timeline**: On track for initial MVP release

### Component Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Layout | 90% | Basic structure complete, needs refinement |
| Deal Table | 70% | Basic functionality works, needs filtering |
| KPI Cards | 60% | Structure complete, needs real data integration |
| Timeline Chart | 50% | Basic chart works, needs interactivity |
| Heatmap | 30% | Basic structure only, needs implementation |
| Company Profile | 40% | Page structure complete, needs data integration |
| Deal Modal | 80% | Functionality complete, needs styling refinement |

### Page Status
| Page | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Dashboard | 60% | Layout complete, needs final components |
| Deal Explorer | 70% | Basic functionality works, needs filtering enhancements |
| Company Profile | 50% | Structure complete, needs data integration |
| Indication Heatmap | 30% | Basic structure only, visualization in progress |
| About/Methodology | 20% | Structure only, content needed |

## Known Issues

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Responsive Layout**: Some components don't adapt well to very small screens
   - Priority: Medium
   - Status: Identified, not fixed

2. **Table Pagination**: Deal table pagination needs optimization for large datasets
   - Priority: High
   - Status: In progress

3. **Chart Rendering**: Timeline chart has performance issues with large datasets
   - Priority: Medium
   - Status: Identified, not fixed

### Data Issues
1. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Some deal values have inconsistent formatting in the JSON data
   - Priority: High
   - Status: In progress

2. **Missing Data Handling**: Better fallbacks needed for missing or null data
   - Priority: Medium
   - Status: Identified, not fixed

3. **Date Parsing**: Inconsistent date handling across components
   - Priority: Medium
   - Status: Identified, not fixed

### Technical Debt
1. **Type Definitions**: Some components lack comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   - Priority: Medium
   - Status: Ongoing improvement

2. **Component Reusability**: Some components have hardcoded values that limit reuse
   - Priority: Low
   - Status: Identified, not fixed

3. **Test Coverage**: Limited test coverage for existing components
   - Priority: High
   - Status: Planned for next sprint
